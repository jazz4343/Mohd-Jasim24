    <p> A very warm welcome !.I am Mohamad Jasim currently a student in Bendemeer Secondary doing Secondary 5.
        My passion revolves around technology,since young I grew up with technology where
        I always play around with the computer system and take the hardware apart to know how it works
       and I learned a lot from there. I have also attended online
        courses to expand my knowledge in coding.<br><br>
<p>
<p> I would like to clarify I coded all the pages with HTML and CSS.<P>
